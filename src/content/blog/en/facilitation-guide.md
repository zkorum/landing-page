## How Can Agora Help Facilitators?

Agora doesn't replace face-to-face or online meetings—it complements them. There are several reasons why you might choose to use Agora for your deliberation projects:

- **Identifying important issues ahead of a session:** Get a sense of what matters to your participants to inform discussion points for in-person or online meetings, including areas of consensus and division.
- **Gauge opinions during or after a session:** Collect feedback and insights from participants to evaluate outcomes. Measure shifts in understanding, agreement, and priorities.
- **Widening participation:** Create a digital conversation that everyone can contribute to, including those who can't make meetings or who find it difficult to speak up.

## Set Up

We will create an organizational profile linked to your personal Agora account. To set this up, we will need:

- Your organization's name and logo
- Your Agora username

Contact us at [hello@zkorum.com](mailto:hello@zkorum.com) to get started.
